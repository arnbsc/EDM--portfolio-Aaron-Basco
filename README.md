## About Me
Hey there! I’m currently a first-year college student working towards a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. I’m passionate about coding and problem-solving, always eager to refine my skills and apply them to real-world challenges. With a solid foundation in C and a growing understanding of Python, I’m diving into areas like software development, process automation, and data handling.

As I continue my studies, I’m looking forward to expanding my knowledge in programming, databases, and system analysis to explore how technology drives innovation. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can exchange ideas, contribute to projects, and continuously enhance my abilities. Whether it's through coding challenges, hands-on projects, or internships, I’m always eager to apply what I’ve learned and stay on top of new technologies.

Outside of academics, I enjoy experimenting with new coding projects, staying up to date with tech advancements, and sharpening my expertise in software development. My ultimate goal is to build a strong foundation in Information Systems and contribute to innovative solutions that drive efficiency and success in the tech industry. I’m excited for the journey ahead and the chance to learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact!
